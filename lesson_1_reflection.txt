How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?
I didnt have to look through ALL the lines, just the ones that changed


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
Find and resolve bugs much quicker, always having a working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

With Git i decide when its worth it creating a commit but i have to remember, 
google docs does it for me but sometimes is not worth it


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Git is geared towards whole projects?


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log para ver los commits, git diff entre 2 commits consecutivos para ver los 
cambios

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

Knowing i can just go back to a working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
